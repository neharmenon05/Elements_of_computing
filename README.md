# Elements_of_computing

# Part A
**Objective:** 
Design and implement a 16-bit HACK CPU using Nand2Tetris, capable of performing arithmetic and logical operations, handling memory access, and executing programs.

**Methodology:**
  -Build basic logic gates using NAND gates.
  -Create more complex gates like multiplexers, decoders, and adders.
  -Combine these gates to create memory units, registers, and ALU.
  -Design the CPU architecture using the Von Neumann model.
  -Implement control logic to interpret instructions and coordinate operations.
  -Use HDL for component description and simulation tools for testing.

**Outcome:**
Provides hands-on experience in building a computer system, understanding digital logic, computer architecture, and principles of computation.


# Part B

**Objective:**
Take the Gray code output from a rotary encoder and display the rotary shaft's position on a 7-segment display.

**Methodology:**
  -Convert Gray code to binary, then to decimal, and finally to a 7-segment display.
  -Use a microcontroller for conversions and display.
  -Ensure accurate representation of the angular position of the shaft through rigorous testing and debugging.

**Outcome:** 
Comprehensive understanding of rotary encoders, Gray code to binary conversions, binary to decimal conversions, and 7-segment display interfacing.
